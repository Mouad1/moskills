### 🔁 Replay Prompt

> Paste this into a fresh Claude session to reimplement this feature from scratch.

---

**Context:** [Project name]. Stack: [stack]. Relevant existing files: [list key files/services already in place].

**Task:** Implement [feature name / one-line description].

**Constraints & decisions already made:**
- [decision 1 — e.g. "Use BullMQ over cron for job scheduling"]
- [decision 2]

**Steps to follow:**
1. [step 1]
2. [step 2]
3. [step N]

**Config required:**
- `VAR_NAME` = `[SECRET: VAR_NAME]` — [purpose]
- File `path/to/config` → set `key` to `value`

**Dependencies to install:**

npm install [package]@[version]
```

**Done when:**
